## 3D render? maybe

Top-down view?
Perspective view?

## Reverse kinematics? no

Move claw in raw XYZ coordinate, reverse kinematics to make it happen
smoothly.

Implementation of reverse kinematics is known to be hard.

Multiple solutions. Need no-go zones. Don't break through your leg.

# UI behaviors

Dial & Slider
  show desired & actual positions

Button wrist_rot calibrate
  wrist_rot offset -= current wrist_rot reading
  Makes current wrist_rot reading appear as 0.

Button reset
  Sends /move with everything set to 0

Icon connection status
  Shows whether we are connecting or connected

Radio mode = mimic preview
  Shows readings from mimic without sending them to real arm

Radio wrist gimble = on
  Forces mimic preview on for the wrist_rot
